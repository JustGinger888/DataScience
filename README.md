## Assessment Task

The amount of data in the world is exploding. In particular, the healthcare industry is generating large amounts of data, driven by a wide range of  medical and healthcare functions, including clinical records, medical images, genomic data, health behaviours, clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and public health management. The challenges include capturing, storing, searching, sharing, analysing, and then finding
insights from complex, noisy, heterogeneous, longitudinal, and voluminous data. To take advantage of the massive amounts of data in healthcare fields and provide the right intervention to patients, methods such as personalised care, visualisation tools and predictive models can help benefit all the end users of a healthcare system. Big data analytics needs to bridge data mining and healthcare informatics communities. The aim of this coursework is to demonstrate data analytics and data visualisation that could be used in healthcare. Apart from the hands-on skills learned from developing the platform, independent work skills and report-writing skills will be enhanced. 



## Part A
### Data Selection
- You need to search for open datasets, 
 - Import some medical data 
 - Manipulate the data by using 
   - Appropriate visualisation tools 
   - Or libraries of your choice. 
 - The visualisation of the chosen dataset 
   - Must be documented with providing rationale behind using either of the tools
   - And its relevance in the healthcare sector.

### Data Preparation
- Assess the quality of your data using suitable techniques. 
- Clean the data if and as necessary. 
- Your report should document and justify any techniques you have utilised 
  - to assess the quality of the data. 
  - Your justification must be informed by research.

### Data Exploration: 
- Utilise suitable data mining tools 
- and analysis techniques to find 
  - significant patterns and trends 
  - SPSS, Excel, Tableau, WEKA, Python libraries, etc 
- Explain the patterns you have observed.


## Part B
Your report should clearly present a proposal on how you identified a problem in the dataset and how you can construct a model to make predictions or forecast trends.

### Data Modelling and Visualisation
- Use appropriate tools to perform some visualisation on the chosen dataset. 
- The choice is yours, based on your future intention of work 
- And also the familiarity of the tool. 
- Your report should document and justify the techniques you have used to 
  - Mine and analyse the data 
  - And the patterns or trends that were discovered. 
- Finally, construct a model that can make some predictions or forecast trends.

### Evaluation
- Critically evaluate your results 
- and compare your findings to other similar studies.

For both part A and B, it is important to provide evidences (related work) from the literature and case study examples for your chosen tool in the healthcare data analysis domain.
